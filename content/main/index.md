## Libraries:
- [dstats](dstats/) A statistics library with a reasonable balance of performance and ease-of-use
- [libcerf](libcerf/) Complex error functions, along with Dawson, Faddeeva, and Voigt functions
- [parallel_algorithm](parallel_algorithm/) Thread-parallelised implementations of various basic algorithms
- [scid](scid/) A collection of numerical routines and bindings

## Bindings:
- [OpenMPI](OpenMPI/) The most common message passing interface in high performance computing
- [clFFT](clFFT-D/) OpenCL accelerated FFTs
- [NetCDF](NetCDF-D/) A common binary data storage format, based on hdf
- [cblas](cblas/) Bindings to BLAS

## Language Interfaces
- [PydMagic](PydMagic/) Use D in a python Ipython/Jupyter notebook. See also [pyd](https://github.com/ariovistus/pyd) for the underlying general purpose D/Python interface.

## Beyond DlangScience
- [code.dlang.org](https://code.dlang.org) has a great many packages relating to science.

# Development and Contributions
We are actively looking for contributors, both from a fresh start or with existing code to contribute. Message us at [gitter.im/DlangScience/public](https://gitter.im/DlangScience/public) or make a pull request. Even the smallest of things can help!

Bugs should be reported as github issues in the relevant repository.

Some preliminary help for new contributors is [here](contrib_help.html).
