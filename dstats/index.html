<h1>dstats</h1>

<p>A statistics library for D, emphasising a middle ground between performance and ease <br>
of use. This repository is a fork of David Simcha's <a href="https://github.com/dsimcha/dstats">https://github.com/dsimcha/dstats</a><br>
created to bring the library up to date and enable dub support.</p>

<h3><a href="https://DlangScience.github.io/dstats/api">Click here for documentation</a></h3>

<h2>Building</h2>

<h3>dub</h3>

<p>Simply add dstats as a dependency in your projects dub.json</p>

<p>The SciD version of dstats is not currently supported in dub.</p>

<h3>manual</h3>

<p>This library has no mandatory dependencies other than the latest versions of Phobos <br>
and DMD.<br>
To build, simply unpack all the files into an empty directory and do a:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>dmd -O -inline -release -lib -ofdstats.lib <span class="pl-k">*</span>.d</pre></div>

<p>SciD is an optional dependency, as Dstats is slowly being integrated into it.<br>
If used, it enables a few extra features and faster implementations of some <br>
algorithms.<br>
To build with this enabled, make sure your SciD directory is in your import path and <br>
do:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>dmd -O -inline -release -lib -ofdstats.lib -version=scid <span class="pl-k">*</span>.d</pre></div>

<p>You'll then need to link in your SciD library and Blas and Lapack libraries when <br>
compiling<br>
an application that uses Dstats.</p>

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>A delicate balance between ease of use, flexibility and performance should be maintained.<br><br>
There are tons of good libraries for hardcore numerics programmers that emphasize performance above <br>
all else.  There are also tons of good statistics packages for people who are basically <br>
non-programmers and aren't doing large-scale analyses or analyses in the context of larger programs.<br><br>
The distribution seems very bimodal.  This library tries to target the middle ground and recognize<br>
the principles of tradeoffs and diminishing returns with regard to performance, flexibility <br>
and ease of use.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything should work with the lowest common denominator generic range possible.  It's <br>
frustrating to have to write tons of boilerplate code just to translate data from one format into <br>
another.  Also, oftentimes even if the data is in the form of an array it needs to be copied so it <br>
can be reordered without the reordering being visible to the caller.  In these cases, it can be <br>
copied just as easily whether the input data is in the form of an array or some other range.</p></li>
<li><p>Throwing exceptions vs. returning NaN:  The convention here is that an exception should be<br>
thrown if a primitive parameter (i.e. an int or a float) is not in the acceptable range.  This is<br>
because such things can trivially be checked upfront and should not occur by accident in most cases,<br>
except for the case of bugs internal to dstats.  If the errant function parameter is the dataset, <br>
i.e. a range of some kind, then a NaN should be returned, because when doing large-scale analyses, <br>
a few pieces of data are expected to be defective in ways that are not easy to check upfront and <br>
should not halt the whole analysis.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In general, this means that dstats.distrib should throw on invalid parameters,<br>
and all other modules should return a NaN.  Any other result is most likely a bug.<br><br>
Cases where dstats.tests calls into dstats.distrib, resulting in thrown exceptions, are <br>
unfortunately too common and need to be fixed.</p>

the main author (David Simcha) are licensed under the Boost license, so that pieces of them may

<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<p><a href="https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9449">https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9449</a> causes a segfault in <code>dstats.tests.friedmanTest</code> on the line <code>Mean[len] colMeans;</code>. This is a backend bug and does not affect ldc or gdc.</p>
